# alxoilerplate
A boilerplate repo for quickly spinning up creative websites using WebGL via OGL and GSAP.

## Description
The boilerplate in this repo is based on Luis Bizarro's "bizarroilerplate" repo [here](https://github.com/bizarro/bizarroilerplate). The goal is to quickly get you up and running with an infrastructure that supports development of creative websites using WebGL to animate 3D scenes and create unique user interactions that push the envelope of what's possible on the web.

Big thanks to @bizarro for his open source contributions! Check out his Awwwards course [here](https://www.awwwards.com/academy/course/building-an-immersive-creative-website-from-scratch-without-frameworks) to learn more about how all these technologies work.

## Getting Started

- [ ] Clone the repo
- [ ] run `yarn install` at the root of the project
- [ ] run `yarn dev` to kick off the Express server and build process
- [ ] navigate to `http://localhost:8160/`

If everything worked as intended you should see a splash screen with a rotating torus!
